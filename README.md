UCI data analytic bootcamp module 14 challenge

- The 'static/js' folder contains my code under file name 'app.js' for the assignment.
- The top level contains provided code under files 'index.html' and 'samples.json' that I used for creating my app and also for collecting my data.

*** all the code within this repository is my own work with the aid of the bootcamps' in-class activities, the Xpert Learning Assistant, instructor help, and various documentation such as from plotly and more to aid with my layout and overall formatting for my completed application.
